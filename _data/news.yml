- title: "We Opensourced PolymerArchitecture.jl and PolymerArchitectureMakie.jl"
  date: 2025-12-16
  description: "We are excited to announce that we have opensourced two Julia packages: PolymerArchitecture.jl and PolymerArchitectureMakie.jl. These packages provide tools for analyzing and visualizing polymer architectures, including automatic detection of equivalent sub-architectures and visualization using GraphMakie.jl. An accompanying research article utilizing these packages to accelerate polymer SCFT simulations is upcoming."
