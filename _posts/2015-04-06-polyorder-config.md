The configuration file for [Polyorder] can be either in INI or in YAML format. Sample configuration files can be found in the `example` folder in the Polyorder project.

## Format
-----

Here we use the YAML format to demonstrate how to write a configuration file for ``Polyorder``.

{% highlight yaml linenos %}
# Configurations for PolyOrder
---  # begin of new document
Version:  # corresponds to [section] in INI format
    # Format: <major>.<minor>, mapping to a float number.
    # Requires:
    #       <minor> = [0, 1, 2, ..., 9]
    # Compare versions, larger one is the latest one.
    # For example:
    #       9.2 > 9.1 > 8.0 > 7.9
    # certain Model may require minimum version number
    version     : 11.0
    format      : YAML  # the format of this configuration file
IO:  # I/O settings

    is_save_q       : false  # whether to save propagator data

    display_interval: 100
    # interval in unit of SCFT cycle for recording data

Model:  # SCFT model description
    # SCFT models, currently implemented are
    #       [AB, AB3+A]
    model           : AB
    # number of chain types
    # Example:
    #       AB + BC + C + M
    #       n_chains = 4
    n_chain         : 1
    # A list contains number of blocks for each chain.
    # For homopolymer and small molecules, n_block = 1.
    # We refer blocks, homopolymers, and small molecules to components.
    # Then number of components, n_component, is the sum of this list.
    n_block         : [2]
    # A list of the physical segment length of each component.
    # Size of this list is n_component.
    # Taking AB + C + M as an example,
    # where AB is an A-B diblock copolymer),
    # C is a homopolymer,
    # M is a small molecules.
    # Then, the returning list is
    #       [bA, bB, bC, bM]
    a               : [1.0, 1.0]
    # A list of the relative length of each component.
    # Size of this list is n_component.
    # Note the meaning of f depends on the choice of base.
    # For example, for an AB + C system, the list of f is
    #       [0.2, 0.8, 0.6]
    # which may mean
    #       f_A = N_A / N_AB
    #       f_B = N_B / N_AB
    #       f_C = N_C / N_AB
    # where N_AB = N_A + N_B.
    # Or, equivalently, f may write as
    #      [0.125, 0.5, 0.375]
    # which means
    #      f_A = N_A / N_ABC
    #      f_B = N_B / N_ABC
    #      f_C = N_C / N_ABC
    # where N_ABC = N_A + N_B + N_C.
    # The list is optional when Algorithm_MDE.f_mode = fix-ds.
    f               : [0.5, 0.5]
    # A list of the volume fraction of each chain specie.
    # Size of this list is n_chain.
    # In canonical ensemble, it is the volume fraction $\phi$.
    # In grand canonical ensemble, it is the activity $z$.
    # For example, in canonical ensemble
    #       AB + C
    #       phi = [phi_AB, phi_C]
    # where phi_AB + phi_C = 1.0 for mass conservation.

    # These (\chi N)s are listed in the following way,

## Notes
-----

### All Format

- No difference will be caused by changing the suquences of the parameters.
- `BC_coefficients_left` and `BC_coefficients_right` vectors are $$(a,b,c)$$ where $$au_x + bu = c$$.
- The minimum `tol_cell` is 3.0e-8.

### INI Only

- Comments can be added as a "#"-leading-line.
- Key and value should be comparted by a equal sign, and all blank character
  between keys and values will be neglected automatically.
- The trailing whitespaces may cause serious problem, they should be removed carefully.
- Support section name. Section name is enclosed by square bracket.

### YAML Only

- For YAML format, block comments are lead by "#", and inline comments are also lead by "#" but should have at least one space between "#" and main content.

## Changelog
-----

### Version 11.0

- Now configuration file is in YAML format.

Version 10.3

- Add `Model.phi` to specify the volume fraction of each specie.

Version 10.2

- Add `Grid.scft_init_type` to specify initialization densities or potential fields or propagators.

Version 10.1

- Add `Algorithm_MDE.f_mode` to allow controlling how to determine volume fraction.

Version 10.0

- Add `Version`, `Algorithm_MDE`, `Algorithm_SCFT`, `Algorithm_Cell_Optimization`, `Algorithm_Contour_Integration` sections.
- Remove `SCFT.is_batch_cell`
- Move some keys to new sections
- Break SCFT section into `IO` and `Algorithm_SCFT` sections.
- Use `tests/test_config_v10` to test whether a configuration file is consistent internally.

Version 9.0 and before

- 2014.06.12 Compatible with current version of Polyorder.
- 2013.07.31 Compatible with scftpy/bulk.
- 2013.06.24 Add `q_file`.
- 2012.11.08 Add `BC` support.
- 2012.10.11 Currently, only supports one type of chain.
- 2012.10.10 Break compatability with previous version. Only for scftpy use. Move `Ms` from `Model` section to `Grid` section.
- 2012.4.24 Add `dielectric_constant`, `charge_distribution` to `Algorithm` section. Delete `isAnnealed` from `Model` section.
- 2012.4.22 Add `Algorithm` section
- 2012.4.20 Add `fft2mg_mode` and `fft2mg_interp`
- 2012.4.18 Add `gensym.py` support

## ToDo List
-----

- Refractor `Config.cc/Config.h` to let `Config` be a format independent class. Support both INI and YAML format. And easy to support other formats, such as JSON, XML, etc.
