I (刘一新, Yi-Xin Liu) am a [polymer physicist at Department of Macromolecular Science of Fudan University](http://polymer.fudan.edu.cn/Data/View/1660) since 2012.
Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Fudan University from 2009 to 2012.
I received my PhD in Polymer Physics from Peking University China in 2009 and my BSc from Nanjing University China in 2004.
I have spent two years (07/2014 - 07/2016) performing research, as a visiting researcher, in collaboration with Prof. Glenn H. Fredrickson in Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at University of California, Santa Barbara, on the fields of computational polymer field theory and theoretical polymer physics.
My [current research interests]({{site.url}}/research) lie in the area of soft matter physics and [scientific software]({{site.url}}/software), including polymer field theory (both mean-field and beyond mean-field) and related numerical algorithms, phase behavior and structures of block copolymers, polymer brushes and polyelectrolytes in bulk and under confinements, directed self-assembly, and ultrathin film crystallization.
I have published [24 peer-reviewed research papers]({{site.url}}/publications) in peer reviewed journals.

If you wish to use any copyright material on this website, please contact me via the Email or address listed above to obtain a permission.

This website is designed for **math** and **code** intensive blogging, particularly suited for computational scientist. The main features are:

* Minimal visual components plus a responsive, paper-like, extremely clean appearance. Let visitors focus on the main content of a post.
* Beautiful Inline and display math equations rendered by [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
* Markdown code block fences are rendered with line numbers by default and with a carefully tweaked solarized light theme.
* Code blocks and its output look similar to Jupyter Notebook.
* Julia and Python REPL code blocks.
* Comments powered by [utterances](https://utteranc.es/).
* Pre-designed TOC and alerts.
* Support Twitter Card.
* Support per tag Atom feeds, see <samp>feed_julia.xml</samp> for an example.
