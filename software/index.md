Scientific software development plays a very important role in my research. Along with my research, I have developed some computing software to carry out the actual task. The software are coded in various programming languages, such as C/C++, Python, Matlab, Fortran and so on. All software listed here are open source software. They are licensed by either BSD or GPL v3.

## Polyorder
-----

Polyorder is a C++ library which aims to ease the development of polymer self-consistent field theory (SCFT) programs.

### Features


* Flexibility. All components can be replaced.

* Extensibility. The OO design enables one add new features smoothly.

* Non-orthogonal unit cell calculations are supported.

* Weakly charged polymers are supported natively.

* Supporting scripts.

### Getting Started

* [Introduction to the Polyorder project]({{ site.url }}/downloads/polyorder20120628.pdf)

* [Configuration file format]({% post_url 2015-04-06-polyorder-config %})

### Useful Links

* [Polyorder source code](https://bitbucket.org/liuyxpp/polyorder)

* [Polyorder documentation](https://bitbucket.org/liuyxpp/polyorder)

## PyDiagram
-----

PyDiagram is a python package for creating a phase diagram from results generated by PolyOrder.

### Features

* Support three kinds of phase diagrams: 1) only phase points; 2) only phase boundaries; 3) both phase points and phase boundaries.

* Find invalid simulations and plot them.

* Plot other phase point asscociated properties: free energy, optimum cell size, residual error, and state of separation.

* Plot the cell size optimization process.

## Gyroid
-----

Gyroid is a python package that generates *symmetry adapted basis functions* based on the space group of a unit cell.

### Features

* Support 1D, 2D and 3D symmetry groups.

* Has a structure renderer.

* Output data as input data for polyorder.

* Install with pip/easy_install

* Well documented.

## NGPy
-----

NGPy is a web application that enable online performing and analyzing Monte-Carlo simulation on nucleation and growth phenomena. It can be also used as a web framework to develop your own web applications.

### Features

* Multiple simulation instances.

* Analyze simulation data online.

* Retrieve result data online.

* Install with pip/easy_install

## mpltex
-----

mpltex is a python package for creating publication-quality plots using matplotlib. Inspired by [Olga Botvinnik](http://olgabotvinnik.com/)'s python package [prettyplotlib](https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib).

### Features

* Create plots for American Chemical Society.

* Create plots for presentation slides.

* Create plots for webpages.

* The internal matplotlib color cycle is replaced by ColorBrewer Set1 scale which looks less saturated and more pleasing to eyes.

* enable cycle line styles and a selected set of line markers including hollow type markers.
